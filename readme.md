## Project Vision
The vision of BrainstormingToken is to create a tokenized ecosystem that promotes active participation in creative and problem-solving processes. By rewarding users for their valuable contributions, we aim to foster an environment of collaboration and innovation. Whether in education, corporate settings, or community-driven projects, BRT will empower participants to engage more effectively and be rewarded for their input.
